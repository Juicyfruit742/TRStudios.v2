# TRStudios.v2

This is my studio "template" website. It uses the bootstrap framework, with custom CSS styling, and javascript.
Doesn't require anything special to run the website other than an internet connection. 

Notes:
-The custom CSS is mostly used to style the lightbox, footer, and basic styling changes. 
-The custom Javascript is used to create the lightbox for the photo section on the projects page.
